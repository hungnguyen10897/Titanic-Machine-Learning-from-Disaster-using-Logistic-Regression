This is a machine learning competition on kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Goal

In this competition, the goal is to predict the classification of survival or deceased.

## Data

Data is given by the competition homepage. For the jupyter-notebook, one part of the data that has been cleaned is used.


The jupyter-notebook represents the process in the real competition, which includes: Loading data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, Creating local evaluation approach (train_test_spit), Build and test model. The notebook does not include the last part where we use the model to predict actual test set which then be used for the competition's scoring.
